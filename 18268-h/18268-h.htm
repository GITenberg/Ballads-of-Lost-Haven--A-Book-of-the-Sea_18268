<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I was born for deep-sea faring;</div>
<div>I was bred to put to sea;</div>
<div>Stories of my father's daring</div>
<div>Filled me at my mother's knee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>I was sired among the surges;</div>
<div>I was cubbed beside the foam;</div>
<div>All my heart is in its verges,</div>
<div>And the sea wind is my home.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>All my boyhood, from far vernal</div>
<div>Bourns of being, came to me</div>
<div>Dream-like, plangent, and eternal</div>
<div>Memories of the plunging sea.</div>
</div></div>

<h2><a name="THE_GRAVEDIGGER" id="THE_GRAVEDIGGER"></a>THE GRAVEDIGGER</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, the shambling sea is a sexton old,</div>
<div>And well his work is done.</div>
<div>With an equal grave for lord and knave,</div>
<div>He buries them every one.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Then hoy and rip, with a rolling hip,</div>
<div>He makes for the nearest shore;</div>
<div>And God, who sent him a thousand ship,</div>
<div>Will send him a thousand more;</div>
<div>But some he'll save for a bleaching grave,</div>
<div>And shoulder them in to shore,&mdash;</div>
<div>Shoulder them in, shoulder them in,</div>
<div>Shoulder them in to shore.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, the ships of Greece and the ships of Tyre</div>
<div>Went out, and where are they?</div>
<div>In the port they made, they are delayed</div>
<div>With the ships of yesterday.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>He followed the ships of England far,</div>
<div>As the ships of long ago;</div>
<div>And the ships of France they led him a dance,</div>
<div>But he laid them all arow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, a loafing, idle lubber to him</div>
<div>Is the sexton of the town;</div>
<div>For sure and swift, with a guiding lift,</div>
<div>He shovels the dead men down.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>But though he delves so fierce and grim,</div>
<div>His honest graves are wide,</div>
<div>As well they know who sleep below</div>
<div>The dredge of the deepest tide.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, he works with a rollicking stave at lip,</div>
<div>And loud is the chorus skirled;</div>
<div>With the burly rote of his rumbling throat</div>
<div>He batters it down the world.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>He learned it once in his father's house,</div>
<div>Where the ballads of eld were sung;</div>
<div>And merry enough is the burden rough,</div>
<div>But no man knows the tongue.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, fair, they say, was his bride to see,</div>
<div>And wilful she must have been,</div>
<div>That she could bide at his gruesome side</div>
<div>When the first red dawn came in.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>And sweet, they say, is her kiss to those</div>
<div>She greets to his border home;</div>
<div>And softer than sleep her hand's first sweep</div>
<div>That beckons, and they come.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Oh, crooked is he, but strong enough</div>
<div>To handle the tallest mast;</div>
<div>From the royal barque to the slaver dark,</div>
<div>He buries them all at last.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Then hoy and rip, with a rolling hip,</div>
<div>He makes for the nearest shore;</div>
<div>And God, who sent him a thousand ship,</div>
<div>Will send him a thousand more;</div>
<div>But some he'll save for a bleaching grave,</div>
<div>And shoulder them in to shore,&mdash;</div>
<div>Shoulder them in, shoulder them in,</div>
<div>Shoulder them in to shore.</div>

<h2><a name="THE_YULE_GUEST" id="THE_YULE_GUEST"></a>THE YULE GUEST</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And Yanna by the yule log</div>
<div>Sat in the empty hall,</div>
<div>And watched the goblin firelight</div>
<div>Caper upon the wall:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>The goblins of the hearthstone,</div>
<div>Who teach the wind to sing,</div>
<div>Who dance the frozen yule away</div>
<div>And usher back the spring;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>The goblins of the Northland,</div>
<div>Who teach the gulls to scream,</div>
<div>Who dance the autumn into dust,</div>
<div>The ages into dream.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Like the tall corn was Yanna,</div>
<div>Bending and smooth and fair,&mdash;</div>
<div>His Yanna of the sea-gray eyes</div>
<div>And harvest-yellow hair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Child of the low-voiced people</div>
<div>Who dwell among the hills,</div>
<div>She had the lonely calm and poise</div>
<div>Of life that waits and wills.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Only to-night a little</div>
<div>With grave regard she smiled,</div>
<div>Remembering the morn she woke</div>
<div>And ceased to be a child.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Outside, the ghostly rampikes,</div>
<div>Those armies of the moon,</div>
<div>Stood while the ranks of stars drew on</div>
<div>To that more spacious noon,&mdash;</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>While over them in silence</div>
<div>Waved on the dusk afar</div>
<div>The gold flags of the Northern light</div>
<div>Streaming with ancient war.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>And when below the headland</div>
<div>The riders of the foam</div>
<div>Up from the misty border rode</div>
<div>The wild gray horses home,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>And woke the wintry mountains</div>
<div>With thunder on the shore,</div>
<div>Out of the night there came a weird</div>
<div>And cried at Yanna's door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>They buried me away</div>
<div>In the blue fathoms of the deep,</div>
<div>Beyond the outer bay.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"But in the yule, O Yanna,</div>
<div>Up from the round dim sea</div>
<div>And reeling dungeons of the fog,</div>
<div>I am come back to thee!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>The wind slept in the forest,</div>
<div>The moon was white and high,</div>
<div>Only the shifting snow awoke</div>
<div>To hear the yule guest cry.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Yanna, Yanna,</div>
<div>Be quick and let me in!</div>
<div>For bitter is the trackless way</div>
<div>And far that I have been!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Then Yanna by the yule log</div>
<div>Starts from her dream to hear</div>
<div>A voice that bids her brooding heart</div>
<div>Shudder with joy and fear.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>The wind is up a moment</div>
<div>And whistles at the eaves,</div>
<div>And in his troubled iron dream</div>
<div>The ocean moans and heaves.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>She trembles at the door-lock</div>
<div>That he is come again,</div>
<div>And frees the wooden bolt for one</div>
<div>No barrier could detain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Garvin, bonny Garvin,</div>
<div>So late, so late you come!"</div>
<div>The yule log crumbles down and throws</div>
<div>Strange figures on the gloom;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>But in the moonlight pouring</div>
<div>Through the half-open door</div>
<div>Stands the gray guest of yule and casts</div>
<div>No shadow on the floor.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>The change that is upon him</div>
<div>She knows not in her haste;</div>
<div>About him her strong arms with glad</div>
<div>Impetuous tears are laced.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>She's led him to the fireside,</div>
<div>And set the wide oak chair,</div>
<div>And with her warm hands brushed away</div>
<div>The sea-rime from his hair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Garvin, I have waited,&mdash;</div>
<div>Have watched the red sun sink,</div>
<div>And clouds of sail come flocking in</div>
<div>Over the world's gray brink,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"With stories of encounter</div>
<div>On plank and mast and spar;</div>
<div>But never the brave barque I launched</div>
<div>And waved across the bar.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"How come you so unsignalled,</div>
<div>When I have watched so well?</div>
<div>Where rides the Adrianna</div>
<div>With my name on boat and bell?"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, golden Yanna,</div>
<div>The Adrianna lies</div>
<div>With the sea dredging through her ports,</div>
<div>The white sand through her eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"And strange unearthly creatures</div>
<div>Make marvel of her hull,</div>
<div>Where far below the gulfs of storm</div>
<div>There is eternal lull.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>This midnight I am here,</div>
<div>Because one night of all my life</div>
<div>At yule tide of the year,</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"With the stars white in heaven,</div>
<div>And peace upon the sea,</div>
<div>With all my world in your white arms</div>
<div>You gave yourself to me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"For that one night, my Yanna,</div>
<div>Within the dying year,</div>
<div>Was it not well to love, and now</div>
<div>Can it be well to fear?"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Garvin, there is heartache</div>
<div>In tales that are half told;</div>
<div>But ah, thy cheek is pale to-night,</div>
<div>And thy poor hands are cold!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"Tell me the course, the voyage,</div>
<div>The ports, and the new stars;</div>
<div>Did the long rollers make green surf</div>
<div>On the white reefs and bars?"</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>Though easily I found</div>
<div>The set of those uncharted tides</div>
<div>In seas no line could sound,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"And made without a pilot</div>
<div>The port without a light,</div>
<div>No log keeps tally of the knots</div>
<div>That I have sailed to-night.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"It fell about mid-April;</div>
<div>The Trades were holding free;</div>
<div>We drove her till the scuppers hissed</div>
<div>And buried in the lee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div><hr class='smler' /></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>Loose hands and let me go!</div>
<div>The night grows red along the East,</div>
<div>And in the shifting snow</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"I hear my shipmates calling,</div>
<div>Sent out to search for me</div>
<div>In the pale lands beneath the moon</div>
<div>Along the troubling sea."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Garvin, bonny Garvin,</div>
<div>What is the booming sound</div>
<div>Of canvas, and the piping shrill,</div>
<div>As when a ship comes round?"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"It is the shadow boatswain</div>
<div>Piping his hands to bend</div>
<div>The looming sails on giant yards</div>
<div>Aboard the Nomansfriend.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"She sails for Sunken Harbor</div>
<div>And ports of yester year;</div>
<div>The tern are shrilling in the lift,</div>
<div>The low wind-gates are clear.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>The little while is done.</div>
<div>Thou wilt behold the brightening sea</div>
<div>Freshen before the sun,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"And many a morning redden</div>
<div>The dark hill slopes of pine;</div>
<div>But I must sail hull-down to-night</div>
<div>Below the gray sea-line.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"I shall not hear the snowbirds</div>
<div>Their morning litany,</div>
<div>For when the dawn comes over dale</div>
<div>I must put out to sea."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Garvin, bonny Garvin,</div>
<div>To have thee as I will,</div>
<div>I would that never more on earth</div>
<div>The dawn came over hill."</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Then on the snowy pillow,</div>
<div>Her hair about her face,</div>
<div>He laid her in the quiet room,</div>
<div>And wiped away all trace</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Of tears from the poor eyelids</div>
<div>That were so sad for him,</div>
<div>And soothed her into sleep at last</div>
<div>As the great stars grew dim.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Tender as April twilight</div>
<div>He sang, and the song grew</div>
<div>Vague as the dreams which roam about</div>
<div>This world of dust and dew:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna,</div>
<div>Over the hills of sea</div>
<div>The wind calls and the morning comes,</div>
<div>And I must forth from thee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"But Yanna, Adrianna,</div>

<div>"O Garvin, bonny Garvin&mdash;"</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>Then with the storm foreboding</div>
<div>Far in the dim gray South,</div>
<div>He kissed her not upon the cheek</div>
<div>Nor on the burning mouth,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>But once above the forehead</div>
<div>Before he turned away;</div>
<div>And ere the morning light stole in,</div>
<div>That golden lock was gray.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"O Yanna, Adrianna&mdash;"</div>
<div>The wind moans to the sea;</div>
<div>And down the sluices of the dawn</div>
<div>A shadow drifts alee.</div>

<div>Among the wintry mountains beside the Northern sea</div>
<div>There is a merrymaking, as old as old can be.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Over the river reaches, over the wastes of snow,</div>
<div>Halting at every doorway, the white drifts come and go.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>They scour upon the open, and mass along the wood,</div>
<div>The burliest invaders that ever man withstood.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>With swoop and whirl and scurry, these riders of the drift</div>
<div>Will mount and wheel and column, and pass into the lift.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>All night upon the marshes you hear their tread go by,</div>
<div>And all night long the streamers are dancing on the sky.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Their light in Malyn's chamber is pale upon the floor,</div>
<div>And Malyn of the mountains is theirs for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>She fancies them a people in saffron and in green,</div>
<div>Dancing for her. For Malyn is only seventeen.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Out there beyond her window, from frosty deep to deep,</div>
<div>Her heart is dancing with them until she falls asleep.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Then all night long through heaven, with stately to and fro,</div>
<div>To music of no measure, the gorgeous dancers go.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>The stars are great and splendid, beryl and gold and blue,</div>
<div>And there are dreams for Malyn that never will come true.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Yet for one golden Yule-tide their royal guest is she,</div>
<div>Among the wintry mountains beside the Northern sea.</div>

<h3>A SAILOR'S WEDDING</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>There is a Norland laddie who sails the round sea-rim,</div>
<div>And Malyn of the mountains is all the world to him.</div>
<div>The Master of the Snowflake, bound upward from the line,</div>
<div>He smothers her with canvas along the crumbling brine.</div>
<div>He crowds her till she buries and shudders from his hand,</div>
<div>For in the angry sunset the watch has sighted land;</div>
<div>And he will brook no gainsay who goes to meet his bride.</div>
<div>But their will is the wind's will who traffic on the tide.</div>
<div>Make home, my bonny schooner! The sun goes down to light</div>
<div>The gusty crimson wind-halls against the wedding night.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>She gathers up the distance, and grows and veers and swings,</div>
<div>Like any homing swallow with nightfall in her wings.</div>
<div>The wind's white sources glimmer with shining gusts of rain;</div>
<div>And in the Ardise country the spring comes back again.</div>
<div>It is the brooding April, haunted and sad and dear,</div>
<div>When vanished things return not with the returning year.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Only, when evening purples the light in Malyn's dale,</div>
<div>With sound of brooks and robins, by many a hidden trail,</div>
<div>With stir of lulling rivers along the forest floor,</div>
<div>The dream-folk of the gloaming come back to Malyn's door.</div>
<div>The dusk is long and gracious, and far up in the sky</div>
<div>You hear the chimney-swallows twitter and scurry by.</div>
<div>The hyacinths are lonesome and white in Malyn's room;</div>
<div>And out at sea the Snowflake is driving through the gloom.</div>
<div>The whitecaps froth and freshen; in squadrons of white surge</div>
<div>They thunder on to ruin, and smoke along the verge.</div>
<div>The lift is black above them, the sea is mirk below,</div>
<div>And down the world's wide border they perish as they go.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>They comb and seethe and founder, they mount and glimmer and flee,</div>
<div>Amid the awful sobbing and quailing of the sea.</div>
<div>They sheet the flying schooner in foam from stem to stern,</div>
<div>Till every yard of canvas is drenched from clew to ear'n'.</div>
<div>And where they move uneasy, chill is the light and pale;</div>
<div>They are the Skipper's daughters, who dance before the gale.</div>
<div>They revel with the Snowflake, and down the close of day</div>
<div>Among the boisterous dancers she holds her dancing way;</div>
<div>And then the dark has kindled the harbor light alee,</div>
<div>With stars and wind and sea-room upon the gurly sea.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>The storm gets up to windward to heave and clang and brawl;</div>
<div>The dancers of the open begin to moan and call.</div>
<div>A lure is in their dancing, a weird is in their song;</div>
<div>The snow-white Skipper's daughters are stronger than the strong.</div>
<div>They love the Norland sailor who dares the rough sea play;</div>
<div>Their arms are white and splendid to beckon him away.</div>
<div>They promise him, for kisses a moment at their lips,</div>
<div>To make before the morning the port of missing ships,</div>
<div>Where men put in for shelter, and dreams put forth again,</div>
<div>And the great sea-winds follow the journey of the rain.</div>
<div>A bridal with no morrow, no welling of old tears,</div>
<div>For him, and no more tidings of the departed years!</div>
<div>For there of old were fashioned the chambers cool and dim,</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>In the eternal silence below the twilight's rim.</div>
<div>The borders of that country are slumberous and wide;</div>
<div>And they are well who marry the fondlers of the tide.</div>
<div>Within their arms immortal, no mortal fear can be;</div>
<div>But Malyn of the mountains is fairer than the sea.</div>
<div>And so the scudding Snowflake flies with the wind astern,</div>
<div>And through the boding twilight are blown the shrilling tern.</div>
<div>The light is on the headland, the harbor gate is wide;</div>
<div>But rolling in with ruin the fog is on the tide.</div>
<div>Fate like a muffled steersman sails with that Norland gloom;</div>
<div>The Snowflake in the offing is neck and neck with doom.</div>
<div>Ha, ha, my saucy cruiser, crowd up your helm and run!</div>
<div>There'll be a merrymaking to-morrow in the sun.</div>
<div>A cloud of straining canvas, a roar of breaking foam,</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>The Snowflake and the sea-drift are racing in for home.</div>
<div>Her heart is dancing shoreward, but silently and pale</div>
<div>The swift relentless phantom is hungering on her trail.</div>
<div>They scour and fly together, until across the roar</div>
<div>He signals for a pilot&mdash;and Death puts out from shore.</div>
<div>A moment Malyn's window is gleaming in the lee,</div>
<div>And then&mdash;the ghost of wreckage upon the iron sea.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Ah, Malyn, lay your forehead upon your folded arm,</div>
<div>And hear the grim marauder shake out the reefs of storm!</div>
<div>Loud laughs the surly Skipper to feel the fog drive in,</div>
<div>Because a blue-eyed sailor shall wed his kith and kin,</div>
<div>And the red dawn discover a rover spent for breath</div>
<div>Among the merrymakers who fondle him to death.</div>
<div>And all the snowy sisters are dancing wild and grand,</div>
<div>For him whose broken beauty shall slacken to their hand.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>They wanton in their triumph, and skirl at Malyn's plight;</div>
<div>Lift up their hands in chorus, and thunder to the night.</div>
<div>The gulls are driven inland; but on the dancing tide</div>
<div>The master of the Snowflake is taken to his bride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>And there when daybreak yellows along the far sea-plain,</div>
<div>The fresh and buoyant morning comes down the wind again.</div>
<div>The world is glad of April, the gulls are wild with glee,</div>
<div>And Malyn on the headland alone looks out to sea.</div>
<div>Once more that gray Shipmaster smiles, for the night is done,</div>
<div>And all his snow-white daughters are dancing in the sun.</div>

<h3>THE LIGHT ON THE MARSH</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>The year grows on to harvest, the tawny lilies burn</div>
<div>Along the marsh, and hillward the roads are sweet with fern.</div>
<div>All day the windless heaven pavilions the sea-blue,</div>
<div>Then twilight comes and drenches the sultry dells with dew.</div>
<div>The lone white star of evening comes out among the hills,</div>
<div>And in the darkling forest begin the whip-poor-wills.</div>
<div>The fireflies that wander, the hawks that flit and scream,</div>
<div>And all the wilding vagrants of summer dusk and dream,</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Have all their will, and reck not of any after thing,</div>
<div>Inheriting no sorrow and no foreshadowing.</div>
<div>The wind forgets to whisper, the pines forget to moan,</div>
<div>And Malyn of the mountains is there among her own.</div>
<div>Malyn, whom grief nor wonder can trouble nevermore,</div>
<div>Since that spring night the Snowflake was wrecked beside her door,</div>
<div>And strange her cry went seaward once, and her soul thereon</div>
<div>With the vast lonely sea-winds, a wanderer, was gone.</div>
<div>But she, that patient beauty which is her body fair,</div>
<div>Endures on earth still lovely, untenanted of care.</div>
<div>The folk down at the harbor pity from day to day;</div>
<div>With a "God save you, Malyn!" they bid her on her way.</div>
<div>She smiles, poor feckless Malyn, the knowing smile of those</div>
<div>Whom the too sudden vision God sometimes may disclose</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>Of his wild, lurid world-wreck, has blinded with its sheen.</div>
<div>Then, with a fond insistence, pathetic and serene,</div>
<div>They pass among their fellows for lost minds none can save,</div>
<div>Bent on their single business, and marvel why men rave.</div>
<div>Now far away a sighing comes from the buried reef,</div>
<div>As though the sea were mourning above an ancient grief.</div>
<div>For once the restless Mother of all the weary lands</div>
<div>Went down to him in beauty, with trouble in her hands,</div>
<div>And gave to him forever all memory to keep,</div>
<div>But to her wayward children oblivion and sleep,</div>
<div>That no immortal burden might plague one living thing,</div>
<div>But death should sweetly visit us vagabonds of spring.</div>
<div>And so his heart forever goes inland with the tide,</div>
<div>Searching with many voices among the marshes wide.</div>
<div>Under the quiet starlight, up through the stirring reeds,</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>With whispering and lamenting it rises and recedes.</div>
<div>All night the lapsing rivers croon to their shingly bars</div>
<div>The wizardries that mingle the sea-wind and the stars.</div>
<div>And all night long wherever the moving waters gleam,</div>
<div>The little hills hearken, hearken, the great hills hear and dream.</div>
<div>And Malyn keeps the marshes all the sweet summer night,</div>
<div>Alone, foot-free, to follow a wandering wisp-light.</div>
<div>For every day at sundown, at the first beacon's gleam,</div>
<div>She calls the gulls her brothers and keeps a tryst with them.</div>
<div>"O gulls, white gulls, what see you beyond the sloping blue?</div>
<div>And where away's the Snowflake, she's so long overdue?"</div>
<div>Then, as the gloaming settles, the hilltop stars emerge</div>
<div>And watch that plaintive figure patrol the dark sea verge.</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<div class="stanza">
<div>She follows the marsh fire; her heart laughs and is glad;</div>
<div>She knows that light to seaward is her own sailor lad!</div>
<div>What are these tales they tell her of wreckage on the shore?</div>
<div>Delay but makes his coming the nearer than before!</div>
<div>Surely her eyes have sighted his schooner in the lift!</div>
<div>But the great tide he homes on sets with an outward drift.</div>
<div>So will-o'-the-wisp deludes her till dawn, and she turns home</div>
<div>In unperturbed assurance, "To-morrow he will come."</div>
<div>This is the tale of Malyn, whom sudden grief so marred.</div>
<div>And still each lovely summer resumes that sweet regard,&mdash;</div>
<div>The old unvexed eternal indifference to pain;</div>
<div>The sea sings in the marshes, and June comes back again.</div>

<div>All night the lapsing rivers lisp in the long dike grass,</div>
<div>And many memories whisper the sea-winds as they pass;</div>
<div>The tides disturb the silence; but not a hindrance bars</div>
<div>The wash of time, where founder even the galleon stars.</div>
<div>And all night long wherever the moving waters gleam,</div>
<div>The little hills hearken, hearken, the great hills hear and dream.</div>

<div>On the long slow heave of a lazy sea,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div>All down, all down by the sleepy town,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div>A fading sail on the far sea-line,</div>

<div>To-day a boy with goldy hair,</div>

<div>The night in her dream let no word pass,</div>

<div>Nor ever a breath that one could feel;</div>
<div>Only the snow shrieked under my heel.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Yet it seemed when I reached the poplar hole,</div>
<div>The ghost of a voice was crying, "Skoal!</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>"Rouse thee and drink, for the well is sweet,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div>'Twas cool to the mouth and slaking at first,</div>
<div>But the lure of it was ill for thirst.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>The voice cried, "Soul of the mortal span,</div>
<div>Art thou not of the Kelpie clan?"</div>

<div>"What are you doing there in the ground,</div>
<div>Kelpie rider, and never a sound</div>

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
